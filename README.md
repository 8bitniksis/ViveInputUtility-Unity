# Vive Input Utility for Unity
Copyright 2016-2017, HTC Corporation. All rights reserved.


## Introduction:

- Vive Input Utility is a Unity plugin that allows developers 
to access [Vive](https://www.vive.com/) device status in handy way, 
including [Vive Tracker](https://www.vive.com/us/vive-tracker/).

- We also introduce a mouse pointer solution that works in 3D space and 
is compatible with the Unity Event System, and a device binding 
system to manage multiple tracking devices.

- Our goal is to accelerate Unity developers making new VR apps and 
discovering new VR experience by saving their time in writing redundant 
code managing Vive devices.


## Requirements:

- Please use Unity 5.3.6 or newer 5.X versions to open the project

- Also import the SteamVR Plugin for Unity. This can be found in [Unity
Asset Store](http://u3d.as/content/valve-corporation/steam-vr-plugin).
